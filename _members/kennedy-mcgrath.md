Kennedy McGrath(’25) and Lila Wilkins(’27) led a project investigating the effect of handling stress on the growth and survival of juvenile zebrafish. They compared the effects of net handling and siphoning, two common handling methods that laboratory zebrafish experience. They found that fish treated with siphoning gained more weight than those treated with net handling. Kennedy and Lila were awarded Runner Up for Most Outstanding poster out of over 300 posters for their presentation at the 2025 Undergraduate Research Conference.
