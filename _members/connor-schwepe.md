My research in the Kwasek lab focused on larval fish nutrition and improving the utilization of plant-based proteins. Specifically, the effects of nutritional programming on zebrafish and largemouth bass. Currently I am a Research Biologist for the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources at the Aquatic Animal Health and Research Center (AAHRC). I work on a variety of projects including cryopreservation of fish sperm, improving walleye larviculture, and control of nuisance fish species. More information on AAHRC can be found at https://wildlife.utah.gov/fes.html .
