I graduated with my bachelor's in biology from the University of New Hampshire in the spring of 2023. Shortly after I began my work as a technician in the UNH Costal Marine Laboratory. Here I worked on a variety of research projects involving mollusks, crustaceans, fish and more! My favorite work was the lumpfish research in the Fairchild lab. We looked at things like what the optimal feed amounts and times for grow out are, at what water velocity a lumpfish can maintain suction, as well as skeletal deformities effects on locomotion.  

I joined the Kwasek lab in the fall of 2024 as an aquaculture lab technician. Iâ€™m excited to continue my work as a laboratory technician to support and work alongside our current graduate students. I will also be working towards starting my own research to begin my masters in the fall of 2025!
