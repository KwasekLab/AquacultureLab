I graduated from Southern Illinois University in May 2024 with my BS in Zoology specializing in Fisheries, Aquaculture and Aquatic Sciences. During my undergraduate degree I conducted two independent research projects. The first was an aquaculture-based investigative study on the environmental plasticity of zebrafish, looking at growth factors and gene expression. The second study looked at the effects of herbicides 2,4-D Amine and Glyphosate on water quality parameters of small freshwater ponds. I am currently in the process of data analysis and writing for publication on both projects.

Having just begun my Master’s degree, I will be looking to expand upon my undergraduate research, looking at the effects of environmental programming using zebrafish as a model, with the intention of expanding my study into commercially important species. My research aims to address the effects of climate change on fish growth and development. If you’re interested in my grad school journey, follow my Instagram! @lauinsci
