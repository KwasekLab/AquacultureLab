During my masters at Southern Illinois University Carbondale I studied nutritional programming
with soybean meal replacement in zebrafish and largemouth bass and the effect it had on the
gut microbiome of the fish. I also studied parental nutritional programming with soybean meal
and effects on the gut microbiome of progeny in zebrafish.

Currently I am a Lead Technician II at Blue Ocean Mariculture in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. Blue
Ocean Mariculture raises Hawaiian Kanpachi (_Seriola rivoliana_) in open water net pens off the
Kona coast. I specifically work in the larval rearing department.
