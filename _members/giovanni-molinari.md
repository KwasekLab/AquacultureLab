Giovanni completed both his MS and PhD in the Kwasek Lab. His MS research focused on improving the use of soybean meal in fish feeds through nutritional programming. His PhD research centered on utilizing species-specific fish protein hydrolysates to produce a formulated feed for larval fish. 
 
He has since worked on a joint postdoctoral position in aquatic toxicology and aquaculture, and currently serves as the Saluki Aquarium Research Coordinator at Southern Illinois University. His work consists of constructing and maintaining systems, while also conducting research on aquaponics and methods to improve the production of Largemouth Bass.
