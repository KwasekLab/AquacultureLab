I started my education in Poland at the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn where I first earned my BSc and MSc degrees in Food Science. My interest in aquaculture and natural curiosity in fish have led me to acquire additional BSc and MSc in Inland Fisheries at the same institution. After exploring the world of soil and its associated microbiology at The Ohio State University I decided to pursue my PhD in Interdisciplinary Environmental Science Graduate Program at OSU where I worked in one of the most well-known fish nutrition laboratories under Dr. Konrad Dabrowski. Eventually I also obtained MBA from the Southern Illinois University.

Since finishing my graduate school, I have acquired different job positions in the field of aquaculture. I first became Production Director in Global Fish (GF) in Poland, the largest RAS facility in Europe at that time. During that period I also worked for Aquamaof (AM) as an international consultant on RAS. Next I became Product Manager for UK in Biomar A/S, a major global aquaculture feed producer, based in Scotland. Since 2018 I have been in positions of Assistant Scientist and later Research Scientist in aquaculture at Southern Illinois University and University of New Hampshire, respectively. Both positions have included management of extensive aquaculture facilities and as well as operational, logistical, and technical responsibility over all aspects of fish production and all aquaculture research projects (shrimp and various fish species including salmonids). In addition, I have been responsible for the design and establishment of freshwater and marine recirculated aquaculture systems (RAS), indoor integrated multi-trophic aquaculture systems (IMTA), and aquaponics.
