My motherland is Scotland, but I moved around quite a bit. I donâ€™t have a formal degree, but I understand that nutrition is essential to help me achieve my athletic goals and maintain my perfect body physique. I support our research efforts by being around. I am naturally pretty chatty, and I make sure everyone can hear me when I have something important to say. Although I love being around humans, I also appreciate my personal bubble like humans do and am protective of it as everyone else is.
