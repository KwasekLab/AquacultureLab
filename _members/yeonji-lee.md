I received my Masterâ€™s degree from Jeju National University, South Korea, where I focused my research on the pyridoxine requirement of Pacific white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei). Currently, I am pursuing a PhD at Jeju National University, continuing my work in aquaculture feed and nutrition research for shrimp and fish species. My studies have identified the DHA and vitamin requirements for Pacific white shrimp, the thiamine requirement for olive flounder, and have also included research on Japanese eel nutrition. Beyond nutrient requirement studies, I investigate the effects of various feed additives, aiming to optimize feed formulations that improve growth performance and nutrient utilization across aquaculture species. Outside of research, I enjoy traveling and exploring different cultures, gaining inspiration and new perspectives through these experiences.
