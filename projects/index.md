We recognize the following main areas in our work: 1) modification of fish, 2) feeds, and 3) feeding methods that help fish thrive in more sustainable environments. All these areas stand on four research pillars that our lab represents: nutritional and environmental programming, gut healing, and larval nutrition.

## Modification of Fish
# NUTRITIONAL PROGRAMMING
Replacement of fishmeal (FM) in aquaculture diets with plant protein (PP) has been an ongoing challenge. High-quality PP concentrates are widely used since their digestibility can be comparable to FM. However, their price can exceed the cost of marine raw materials. Progress with utilization of lower-quality PP meals has been made but a number of concerns must be overcome to maintain acceptable growth rates and feed efficiency values at high FM substitution levels. For example, one of those concerns relates to the presence of anti-nutritional factors that have been associated with intestinal inflammation in fish, which can decrease the capacity of fish digestive tract to digest, absorb, and utilize nutrients negatively affecting fish growth and health. This can be to some extent mitigated by the use of functional dietary components, some of which our lab has also discovered. Our main focus, however, has been placed on nutritional programming (NP) - a promising approach that offsets the negative effects of dietary PP in adult fish through brief introduction of PP at an early age. This brief exposure to PP ultimately develops a coping mechanism that leads to a long-lasting ability of fish to assimilate previously undesirable PP. 

Our lab developed an unconventional NP strategy using live food as PP vehicle. This is a much more effective way of improving fish acceptance and utilization capacity of dietary PP compared to the “traditional” NP method, which is normally induced with dry feed during later fish stages. By using enriched live food to program fish at first feeding, we can begin introduction of PP to the fish at the earliest possible point and prevent the programming process from having a negative effect on the fish development in its early life stages. The combination of live food and PP provides all the nutrients required for proper growth and development and at the same time exposes the fish to alternative raw materials and their associated anti-nutritional factors delivered in low enough concentration to induce adaptation of the fish towards the same dietary components later in their life without impairing larval well-being. Our lab also generated new knowledge surrounding NP and showed for the first time that the mechanism behind NP might be associated with endocrine and morphological adaptation of the digestive system that leads to enhanced digestion and absorption capacity of dietary PP that is ultimately reflected by improved growth performance. 

Why is this important? This feeding strategy becomes a feasible and practical way of enhancing fish utilization ability of diets based on almost any raw material. The practical outcome of this study provides fish farmers and the feed industry with the possibility of using bigger and more cost-effective raw material basket and hence, allows for more flexibility in formulations of diets deprived of FM. This ultimately supports further development of the aquaculture feed market that contributes to the intensification of more sustainable fish production and reduction in fish production costs.

#ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMMING 
Aquaculture continues to significantly increase its production, making it the fastest-growing food production sector worldwide. However, the sustainability of the sector is at risk due to the predicted effects of climate change. Climate change can negatively influence food security through increased water scarcity and increased global temperatures; and those effects are not limited to terrestrial environments, with alterations being seen across freshwater and marine habitats as well. Hence, for food production to increase in a sustainable manner to meet the increasing demand for protein, adjustments to current farming practices must be made to accommodate the warming climate. 

The metabolic rate of poikilothermic (cold-blooded) animals, such as fish, is controlled by temperature and, hence, every species has an optimal temperature range (often only a few degrees wide) within which their overall performance is optimal. Any changes in that optimal range, that is water that is warmer or colder, lead to reduced growth performance and/or survival. Animals, however, are also characterized by a certain degree of environmental plasticity and many of their traits related to behavior, stress response, social skills, can be influenced by early life experiences. These plastic responses provide different species with a coping mechanism to changing environmental conditions without altering their genetic makeup, and they may have lasting consequences for the species well-being and survival. The mechanisms behind the induction of the adaptation process and environmental plasticity are not well understood, however epigenetic alterations in DNA seem to play a major role. Specifically, this means that any major changes experienced briefly in life during early development can cause epigenetic alterations in the genotype that will allow the fish to respond to similar triggers better later in their life. Overall, however, the number of studies investigating how the early experiences to abrupt fluctuations in environmental factors affect plasticity in older fish, is still limited. We help expand this area of research by understanding how brief exposure to stress (such as high temperature) induced during early development in a hatchery affects the growth, survival, feeding efficiency, and stress response in adult fish. We believe that short exposure of the fish during their early development to different stressors that are normally experienced in their changing environment will induce changes in the fish leading to better adaptation of those same fish to similar conditions experienced later in life.

Why is this important? We strongly believe that this environmental programming approach can become an effective tool in generating fast growing and more resilient future fish generations that will be able to withstand water changes associated with global warming. This can not only contribute to growth in fish production as a food source but also allow for rebuilding of fish populations in regions where water temperatures have permanently shifted in their natural environment preventing the establishment of healthy populations.
