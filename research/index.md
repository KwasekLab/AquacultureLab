We continuously explore new research ventures. Over the years our lab has received many resources from state and federal agencies as well as from the industry (fish, feed, and raw material producers). Hence, we aim to tackle aquaculture challenges on a local, national, and global level. Our lab has worked with multiple species (trout, salmon, yellow perch, walleye, largemouth bass, tilapia, zebrafish, and shrimp) using both lab-based as well as hatchery-like research culture systems. Our efforts have been particularly placed on improving hatchery technology. Specifically, we have developed rearing systems destined for species characterized by challenging larval stage that ensure high survival, high swim-bladder inflation, low skeletal deformities, and reduced cannibalism. Although we continuously upgrade and improve our systems today we are able to achieve 50-70% survival of larval percids (up to 7 times higher compared to survival achieved in commercial hatcheries) with 100% swim-bladder inflation and 0% skeletal deformities.
